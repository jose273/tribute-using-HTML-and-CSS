            <li class="list-group-item justify-content-between"><strong>2002-2004</strong> - In 2002, Eliud Kipchoge won at
                the Kenyan trials for the 2002 IAAF World Cross Country Championships junior race. At the World Cross
                Country Championships in Dublin, Kipchoge finished fifth in the individual race and was part of the
                Kenyan junior team that won gold. Kipchoge also won the 5000 metres race at the Kenyan trial for the
                2002 World Junior Championships in Athletics but fell ill and missed the championships. He won the junior
                race at the 2003 IAAF World Cross Country Championships.
                <br>

                He set a world junior record in the 5000 m at the 2003 Bislett Games, running a time of 12:52.61 minutes.
                This stood as the world and African junior record until 2012 when it was improved to 12:47.53 minutes by
                Hagos Gebrhiwet of Ethiopia.
                <br>

                Kipchoge won a gold medal at the 5000 m final at the 2003 World Championships in Paris, outsprinting
                runner-up Hicham El Guerrouj, the world record holder in the 1500 metres and mile, by four-hundredths
                of a second in 12:52.79.
                <br>

                In July, he participated in the Golden League 2004 Roma Meeting. In the 5000 m event, he dipped first
                among the starters with 12:46.53, which made him the sixth-fastest ever in the event.
                <br>

                In 2004, Kipchoge won a bronze medal at the 5000 m final at the 2004 Athens Olympics, behind El
                Guerrouj and Kenenisa Bekele. He also won the Trofeo Alasport cross country race earlier that season.
            </li>
            <li class="list-group-item justify-content-between"><strong>2006</strong> - Kipchoge won the bronze in the
                3000 metres indoor at the 2006 World Championships in Moscow.

                At the end of the year, Kipchoge won the San Silvestre Vallecana New Year's Eve 10 km road race in a
                time of 26:54 minutes, which beat his own course record by 40 seconds. This time was also better than
                the 10K road world record at the time but was run on a downhill course.
            </li>
            <li class="list-group-item justify-content-between"><strong>2007</strong> - Kipchoge won a silver medal at
                the 5000 m final of the 2007 World Championships at Osaka in 13:46.00, behind Bernard Lagat.
            </li>
            <li class="list-group-item justify-content-between"><strong>2008</strong> - During the 2008 Olympics held in
                Beijing, China, Kipchoge won a silver medal in the 5000 m event with a time of 13:02.80; although better
                than the previous Olympic record of 13:05.59, it was not enough to match Kenenisa Bekele's pace, who
                won the gold medal for this race. On the circuit, he won the Great Yorkshire Run 10K and Campaccio Cross
                Country that year.
            </li>
            <li class="list-group-item justify-content-between"><strong>2019</strong> - Kipchoge won the 2019 London
                Marathon in a time of 2:02:37, the second fastest marathon of all time, behind his 2018 Berlin Marathon
                win. He became the first man to win the event four times and set a new course record, beating his own
                2016 London Marathon best by 28 seconds. The lead runner passed the half marathon mark in 1:01:37.
                Mosinet Geremew (Ethiopia) finished as the runner up in 2:02:55, and Mule Wasihun (Ethiopia) came in
                third place in 2:03:16. The British runner Mo Farah, a four-time Olympic gold medalist and a pre-race
                favorite, finished 5th.
            </li>
            <li class="list-group-item justify-content-between"><strong>2022</strong> - On 25 September, Kipchoge won
                the Berlin Marathon decisively in a time of 2:01:09, beating by 30 seconds his own previous world
                record, which he set on the same course in 2018.
